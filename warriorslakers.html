            <p>The 44-31 Golden State Warriors led by Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler take on LeBron James and Luka Doncics’ 46-29 Lakers team. The Western Conference rivalry game is at 10 PM ET/7 PM PT, in Los Angeles. The purple and gold squad is 29-9 at home this season, and currently the 3 seed. The Golden State Warriors are the 5 seed, 2 games behind the Lakers. Lakers lead the season series 3-0. 
            </p>
            <p>The Lakers last played on Monday, March 31st, beating the 2 seed Houston Rockets 104-98. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, April 1st, the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 134-125, with 52 points from Steph Curry. Both teams are rested and healthy. Both teams are fighting for playoff position in an extremely close Western Conference. So, who’s going to win?
            </p>
            <h2>Spread and Odds</h2>
            <p>	FanDuel Sportsbook has LA Lakers ML at -112, while the GS Warriors ML is -104, meaning Lakers are barely favored. The spread is Lakers -1, which means Lakers are expected to win by 1, and this is as close as a spread can get. The over/under (total points scored in the game) is 230. The last time these two teams faced off, they combined for 232 points.</p>   
            <h2>Our Prediction</h2>
            <p>Paper Tiger Media’s prediction for this classic Steph Curry vs. LeBron James matchup? <strong>Lakers win 124-119</strong> in a thrilling fourth quarter. Luka Doncic puts up 33 points and 3 steals, LeBron with 21 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists, and Austin Reaves with a clutch shot in the final minutes of the fourth, finishing with 15 points. Also big defensive games from Gabe Vincent, DFS, and Jarred Vanderbilt. Steph Curry will have 32 points, Jimmy Butler will have 18 points, 6 rebounds, and 1 steal. The halftime score will be Warriors lead 57-54, and Austin Reaves will miss a halfcourt heave at the buzzer. 
            </p>
            <p>Los Angeles is the third best team at home in the NBA, right behind the two 1 seeds of their respective conferences, the OKC Thunder and Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors are 21-17 in away games this season. Lakers are also coming off 4 days of rest, which is huge for a squad with 40 year old LeBron James and a slightly injured Luka Doncic. 
            </p>
            <p>The Lakers and Warriors last met on February 6th, which was a Lakers W. Steph Curry had 37 points, while Lakers star (and GOAT) LeBron James had 42 points and 17 rebounds. Austin Reaves also contributed for the Lakers, recording 23 points, 3 rebounds, and 4 assists. Neither Jimmy Butler nor Luka Doncic played in this game, and Anthony Davis and Andrew Wiggins were traded at this point.</p>
            <p>It is very important to note how much these two teams have changed since their most recent matchup. The Warriors executed a 5 team trade for Jimmy Butler, trading away Andrew Wiggins. Rob Pelinka and the Lakers completed one of the craziest trades in sports history, trading Anthony Davis and Max Christie for superstar Luka Doncic (still doesn’t sound real). Since these trades, both of these teams have been on upward trajectories. The Lakers are 14-8 in games Luka has played, and the Warriors are 19-4 with Jimmy Butler playing.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>In terms of playoff impact, the Lakers would fall to the 4 seed if they lose. Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets would move up and take the 3 seed. As of right now, the Lakers would be facing the Minnesota Timberwolves in the playoffs, and the Warriors would face the Denver Nuggets. With a win, the Warriors would still be a game behind the Lakers. But, the Lakers have a tough schedule, facing the OKC Thunder twice, and the Houston Rockets. A win here would be crucial for both teams in a competitive and tight Western Conference.

            </p> 

            <h2>Cowboys @ Eagles</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Eagles 28, Cowboys 14</p>
            <p>Philly has home field advantage and the more complete roster. Saquon Barkley will carry the load offensively with two touchdowns. Dallas may strike early, but the post-Micah Parsons defense won’t hold up for four quarters.</p>
            <p><b>ML:</b> Eagles (-) | <b>Spread:</b> Eagles -7</p>

            <h2>Chiefs @ Chargers (Friday Night)</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Chargers 24, Chiefs 21</p>
            <p>The Chargers shock the NFL with an early upset. Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are still elite, but Justin Herbert looks comfortable in Greg Roman’s offense. Expect WR Ladd McConkey to shine under the primetime lights.</p>

            <h2>Dolphins @ Colts</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Dolphins 31, Colts 19</p>
            <p>Daniel Jones starts for Indianapolis, but Miami has too much talent on both sides of the ball. Anthony Richardson’s benching casts a shadow over Indy’s season before it even starts.</p>

            <h2>Steelers @ Jets</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Steelers 16, Jets 10</p>
            <p>Defense dominates in East Rutherford. The Jets begin the Justin Fields era, but Mike Tomlin’s Steelers grind out a tough win.</p>

            <h2>Panthers @ Jaguars</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Panthers 28, Jaguars 24</p>
            <p>Bryce Young looks sharper in Year 2, connecting with rookie WR Tet McMillan. Carolina edges Jacksonville in a coaching chess match.</p>

            <h2>Cardinals @ Saints</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Cardinals 21, Saints 16</p>
            <p>Kyler Murray leads Arizona to a scrappy road win. Spencer Rattler struggles in his Saints debut.</p>

            <h2>Giants @ Commanders</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Commanders 34, Giants 12</p>
            <p>Washington, fresh off an NFC Championship run, rolls with Jayden Daniels. Russell Wilson’s Giants debut is a rough one.</p>

            <h2>Buccaneers @ Falcons</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Buccaneers 34, Falcons 31</p>
            <p>Michael Penix Jr. impresses in his NFL debut, but Baker Mayfield and Tampa Bay steal the game with a Chase McLaughlin field goal.</p>

            <h2>Bengals @ Browns</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Bengals 38, Browns 22</p>
            <p>Joe Burrow looks locked in while Cleveland’s revolving door at quarterback continues. Joe Flacco, at 40, won’t be enough.</p>

            <h2>Raiders @ Patriots</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Patriots 27, Raiders 17</p>
            <p>Drake Maye enters Year 2 with confidence as Mike Vrabel returns to the sidelines. Geno Smith and the Raiders keep it close early, but New England pulls away.</p>

            <h2>49ers @ Seahawks</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> 49ers 35, Seahawks 24</p>
            <p>Sam Darnold reunites with his old team, but San Francisco’s depth and defense prove too much.</p>

            <h2>Titans @ Broncos</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Broncos 21, Titans 10</p>
            <p>Bo Nix and Denver’s defense suffocate rookie QB Cam Ward in his first start.</p>

            <h2>Lions @ Packers</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Lions 26, Packers 22</p>
            <p>Two NFC North contenders clash. Jordan Love looks strong, but Detroit’s balance and toughness carry them to victory.</p>

            <h2>Texans @ Rams</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Texans 40, Rams 32</p>
            <p>CJ Stroud rebounds from his sophomore slump with a statement win. Expect a shootout, but Houston’s young core delivers.</p>

            <h2>Ravens @ Bills (Sunday Night Football)</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Bills 28, Ravens 24</p>
            <p>Lamar Jackson vs Josh Allen in primetime delivers fireworks. Buffalo’s home-field advantage tips the balance.</p>

            <h2>Vikings @ Bears (Monday Night Football)</h2>
            <p><b>Prediction:</b> Bears 24, Vikings 14</p>
            <p>JJ McCarthy makes his long-awaited debut after last year’s ACL injury, but Caleb Williams and Rome Odunze steal the show in Chicago.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Week 1 of the 2025 NFL season is packed with storylines: Barkley’s Eagles debut, rookie quarterbacks under pressure, and heavyweight clashes on primetime.

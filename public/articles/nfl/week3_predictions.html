  <p class="article-description">All rights go to the NFL and respective teams.</p>

  <h2>Bengals vs. Vikings</h2>
  <p>Jake Browning vs. Carson Wentz in 2025. This game will either suck or be amazing, but regardless, Jake Browning is a top tier backup and has led the Bengals to wins before. He will continue to do the same vs. Carson Wentz and the Vikings.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Bengals (2-0), Vikings (1-1)<br>
     <b>Key Stat:</b> Minnesota is averaging just 14 PPG while allowing 27.5 PPG.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Bengals 24, Vikings 10</b></p>

  <h2>Texans vs. Jaguars</h2>
  <p>The Houston Texans are currently 0-2 after losing 14-9 and 20-19 to the Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers respectively. Both of these are good teams, but the Texans don’t inspire confidence. Jaguars will win a close one at home.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Texans (0-2), Jaguars (1-1)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Jaguars 23, Texans 20</b></p>

  <h2>Colts vs. Titans</h2>
  <p>The Colts look amazing — something no one, including myself, would have predicted. In fact, I myself predicted the Colts to go 7-10 in an article from March. <a href="https://papertigersmedia.com/articles/nfl/coltssuccess.html" target="_blank">Read it here</a>. Through 2 games, the Colts have yet to punt and the ball is moving to the red zone. However, in the red zone, the Colts have struggled. Titans and Cam Ward are 0-2, but Cam Ward shows potential and young QBs have had career days vs. the Colts in the past. Ultimately, I am picking the Colts to sneak away with a win in Nashville in an extremely close divisional game.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Colts (2-0), Titans (0-2)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Colts 27, Titans 24</b></p>

  <h2>Raiders vs. Commanders</h2>
  <p>Commanders are starting Marcus Mariota after injuries to Jayden Daniels. Mariota is still a capable QB to a certain extent and Geno Smith looked terrible against the Los Angeles Chargers, posting 180 yards and 3 interceptions. Commanders will win at home.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Raiders (1-1), Commanders (1-1)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Commanders 18, Raiders 6</b></p>

  <h2>Rams vs. Eagles</h2>
  <p>Eagles defeated the Rams 28-22 in the NFC Divisional Round last season, with Saquon Barkley racking up 26 carries for 205 yards and 2 TDs in the snow. Rams have looked competitive and are seeking their revenge. Saquon Barkley will do his thing, but I am taking Rams with the upset.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Rams (2-0), Eagles (2-0)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Rams 32, Eagles 24</b></p>

  <h2>Falcons vs. Panthers</h2>
  <p>There is not too much to say about this game. Panthers looked terrible against the Cardinals, until they locked in during the fourth quarter and lost the game 27-22. Bryce Young looks shaky, Legette sucks, and TMac looks really good. I’m taking Penix and the Falcons.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Falcons (1-1), Panthers (0-2)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Falcons 30, Panthers 10</b></p>

  <h2>Steelers vs. Patriots</h2>
  <p>This game should be close. Rodgers and the Steelers fell 31-17 to the Seahawks last Sunday. Steelers defense looks terrible, so for that reason I am taking Drake Maye and the New England Patriots. Drake Maye will have a career day.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Steelers (1-1), Patriots (1-1)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Patriots 22, Steelers 19</b></p>

  <h2>Packers vs. Browns</h2>
  <p>Packers are a good team and while the Browns are doing better than I thought they would, Packers are levels above them. Green Bay recently took care of Washington on Thursday Night Football, winning 27-18, 5 days after beating Detroit 27-13. Packers are Super Bowl contenders and will play like it.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Packers (2-0), Browns (0-2)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Packers 28, Browns 12</b></p>

  <h2>Jets vs. Buccaneers</h2>
  <p>Justin Fields will be out with a concussion that he got when the Jets lost 30-10 to the Bills. Before his concussion, Fields posted 27 yards on 3-11 passing. After the concussion, Tyrod Taylor came in and put up 56 yards and 1 TD on 7-11 passing. The Jets will look to Taylor to propel them past the Buccaneers, but it won’t be enough.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Jets (0-2), Buccaneers (2-0)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Buccaneers 27, Jets 14</b></p>

  <h2>Broncos vs. Chargers</h2>
  <p>The Broncos lost off of a heart-breaking leverage penalty vs. the Colts. They looked good for most of the game, but Bo Nix looked shaky at times against a Colts defense that was missing Laiatu Latu and Charvarius Ward. Jesse Minter and the Chargers defense will pick off Nix twice and come away with the win.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Broncos (1-1), Chargers (2-0)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Chargers 28, Broncos 24</b></p>

  <h2>Saints vs. Seahawks</h2>
  <p>Seahawks beat the Steelers 31-17 last week. Saints fell 26-21 vs. the 49ers, but Rattler put up a solid 25-34 and 207 yards with 3 TDs. Overall, I trust the Seahawks defense and I trust Sam Darnold more than Spencer Rattler.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Saints (0-2), Seahawks (1-1)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Seahawks 34, Saints 17</b></p>

  <h2>Cowboys vs. Bears</h2>
  <p>I am taking the Cowboys to win here with a good day from Dak and more struggles from the Bears. It’s only been two games, so I’m not too worried for the Bears and Ben Johnson, but Bears will lose this one and fall to 0-3.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Cowboys (1-1), Bears (0-2)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Cowboys 38, Bears 14</b></p>

  <h2>Cardinals vs. 49ers</h2>
  <p>49ers will secure the win at home with Mac Jones leading them to victory. Mac Jones had 66% completion rate, 300 yards passing, and 3 TDs vs. the Saints. The Cardinals have squeaked out wins against the Saints and Panthers, two terrible teams. Niners will take this one.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Cardinals (2-0), 49ers (2-0)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: 49ers 29, Cardinals 17</b></p>

  <h2>Chiefs vs. Giants</h2>
  <p>The Chiefs are 0-2 but they lost a close one to the Eagles last week and surely won’t lose to the Giants and fall to 0-3 right? Right? I’m taking the New York Giants and Russell Wilson winning a competitive game vs. Mahomes and the Chiefs in New York. The Giants took the Cowboys to OT last week and it took a 64 yarder by Brandon Aubrey for the Cowboys to even send it to OT. Giants won’t make the same mistakes, and will take care of Andy Reid and his soon to be 0-3 Chiefs.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Chiefs (0-2), Giants (0-2)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Giants 27, Chiefs 24</b></p>

  <h2>Lions vs. Ravens</h2>
  <p>The Lions offense has struggled as they adjust to new OC John Morton, who replaced Ben Johnson. Ravens look like legit contenders, and will back that up on Monday Night Football.</p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Lions (1-1), Ravens (1-1)</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Ravens 35, Lions 24</b></p>

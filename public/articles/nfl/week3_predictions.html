  <h2>Bengals vs. Vikings</h2>
  <p>Jake Browning has proven himself as one of the league’s top backups, stepping in for Joe Burrow and delivering wins. Carson Wentz, on the other hand, hasn’t been a regular starter since 2022. </p>
  <p><b>Records:</b> Bengals (1-1), Vikings (0-2)<br>
     <b>Key Stat:</b> Minnesota is averaging just 14 PPG while allowing 27.5 PPG.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Bengals 24, Vikings 10</b></p>

  <h2>Texans vs. Jaguars</h2>
  <p>The Texans (0-2) have lost heartbreakers — 14-9 to the Rams and 20-19 to the Bucs. The Jags (1-1) have more offensive balance and are at home.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Jaguars 23, Texans 20</b></p>

  <h2>Colts vs. Titans</h2>
  <p>The Colts (2-0) are red hot — they’ve yet to punt this season — but red zone struggles remain. Rookie QB Cam Ward and the Titans (0-2) are searching for their first win. Divisional games are always close, but Indy has the momentum.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Colts 27, Titans 24</b></p>

  <h2>Raiders vs. Commanders</h2>
  <p>Marcus Mariota takes over after Jayden Daniels’ injury. Washington (1-1) still has weapons, while the Raiders (0-2) have looked lost. Geno Smith’s 3-INT outing last week doesn’t inspire confidence in Las Vegas.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Commanders 18, Raiders 6</b></p>

  <h2>Rams vs. Eagles</h2>
  <p>A rematch of last year’s Divisional Round, when the Eagles won 28-22 on the back of Saquon Barkley’s 205-yard day. The Rams (1-1) are hungry for revenge, and their defense has improved.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Rams 32, Eagles 24</b></p>

  <h2>Falcons vs. Panthers</h2>
  <p>Bryce Young continues to struggle for Carolina (0-2). Atlanta (1-1) has looked sharper behind Michael Penix Jr., who has already thrown for 500+ yards in two weeks.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Falcons 30, Panthers 10</b></p>

  <h2>Steelers vs. Patriots</h2>
  <p>A close matchup between Rodgers’ Steelers (1-1) and rookie QB Drake Maye’s Patriots (1-1). Pittsburgh’s defense has been uncharacteristically shaky, giving up 31 to Seattle last week.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Patriots 22, Steelers 19</b></p>

  <h2>Packers vs. Browns</h2>
  <p>Green Bay (2-0) has looked dominant, beating Washington and Detroit in back-to-back weeks. The Browns (1-1) are feisty but lack the firepower to keep up.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Packers 28, Browns 12</b></p>

  <h2>Jets vs. Buccaneers</h2>
  <p>Justin Fields is out with a concussion, so Tyrod Taylor takes over for the Jets (0-2). Tampa Bay (2-0) has shown resilience in tight wins, and they’ll make it three straight here.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Buccaneers 27, Jets 14</b></p>

  <h2>Broncos vs. Chargers</h2>
  <p>The Broncos (0-2) lost a heartbreaker vs. Indy, while Bo Nix still shows rookie growing pains. The Chargers (1-1) defense under Jesse Minter looks legit.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Chargers 28, Broncos 24</b></p>

  <h2>Saints vs. Seahawks</h2>
  <p>The Saints (0-2) fell to San Francisco despite Spencer Rattler’s solid 3-TD performance. Seattle (2-0) just put up 31 on Pittsburgh and looks balanced.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Seahawks 34, Saints 17</b></p>

  <h2>Cowboys vs. Bears</h2>
  <p>Dak Prescott and Dallas (1-1) bounce back at home. The Bears (0-2) are still searching for answers with Ben Johnson as HC.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Cowboys 38, Bears 14</b></p>

  <h2>Cardinals vs. 49ers</h2>
  <p>Mac Jones looked sharp for San Francisco (2-0), throwing 3 TDs against the Saints. The Cardinals (2-0) have squeaked out wins, but against weaker opponents.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: 49ers 29, Cardinals 17</b></p>

  <h2>Chiefs vs. Giants</h2>
  <p>The Chiefs (0-2) are in unfamiliar territory. The Giants (1-1) nearly upset Dallas last week and have Russell Wilson managing the game efficiently.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Giants 27, Chiefs 24</b></p>

  <h2>Lions vs. Ravens</h2>
  <p>Detroit (1-1) is adjusting to new OC John Morton. Baltimore (2-0) has looked like legit contenders, led by Lamar Jackson’s 6 TDs through two games.</p>
  <p><b>Final Score: Ravens 35, Lions 24</b></p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Week 3 is loaded with storylines — from the Colts’ surprising run to the Chiefs’ shocking start. Follow us on Twitter <a href="https://x.com/PaperTigrMedia" target="_blank">@PaperTigrMedia</a> for live updates and reactions.</p>

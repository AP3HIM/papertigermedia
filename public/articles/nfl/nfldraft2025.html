                All rights go to NFL and the teams
             </p> 
            <p> The first round of the 2025 NFL Draft started tonight. And perhaps most surprising (or not at all), Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders has fell out of the first round. Let's break down the picks so far.
            </p>
            <h2>Jaguars Trade up for Travis Hunter</h2>
            <p>The Jacksonville Jaguars made the first trade of the day, trading their first rounder (fifth overall pick which turned into Mason Graham), the 36th pick (second round), the 126th pick (fourth round), and their 2026 first round pick. On the other side, the Jaguars recieved the number 2 pick, or Travis Hunter, the 104th overall pick (fourth round), and the 200th pick (sixth round). Travis Hunter is in my opinion the best player in the draft. He can play WR and CB at a high level, and played more snaps than anyone else in college football last season, for Deion Sander's Colorado Buffaloes.<p>
                
            <p>I like the trade and I agree with being aggresive to get players you want. However, the biggest question mark here is that 2026 first round pick. That pick may end up being very valuable for the Cleveland Browns this time next year. The Jags picked 5th this year, and had back-to-back 1st overall picks three years ago. This is a gamble and depends on Jacksonville and new HC Liam Coen performing this year. I think with a healthy Trevor Lawrence and Travis Hunter either on offense or defense (I think he would be better at CB for the Jags, but we don't know officially which side he will be playing on), Jags will at least be able to avoid the top 5 picks.</p>

            <h2>Surprises</h2>
            <p>There have not been many surprises in this draft thus far. The Chicago Bears picked Michigan TE Colsten Loveland 10th overall over Penn State TE Tyler Warren. While the Bears do have Cole Kmet, Ben Johnson loves to run 12 personnel (Lions ran it the third most last season) and having a blocker like Loveland can be very impactful. The next surprise is Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders falling in the first round. Most mocks didn't have Shedeur going in the top 10, but he has fallen out of the top 10 and top 20. He may even fall out of the first round. It is worth noting the Browns and Giants have the first two picks of the second round, so I would not expect Shedeur to fall any further than pick 34.</p>
            <p class="article-description">
                Update: The New York Giants traded back into the first round to select Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. Giants traded pick 34 to the Houston Texans.

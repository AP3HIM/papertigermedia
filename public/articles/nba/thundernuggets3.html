            <p><i>After a game-winning three point shot in Game 1 and a 43 point blowout in Game 2, the Thunders-Nuggets series heads to Denver tied at 1. Game 1 came down to the last shot; Game 2 was over after OKC scored 45 in the first quarter. Let's try to predict what Game 3 has in store.</i></p>

            <p class="article-description"> 
                All rights go to the NBA and the teams
             </p>In Game 1, Nikola Jokic had 42 points and 22 rebounds, and the Nuggets won on a last second Russell Westbrook pass to Aaron Gordon for the game-winning 3 point shot. However, in Game 2, the Thunder scored 87 points in the first half, en route to a 43 point victory. Game 1 was extremely close, and may have ended in a win for the home team Thunder if Chet Holmgren hit his free throws. While Games 1 and 2 could not be further apart in terms of results, we are confident in our Game 3 predictions. <p>
            </p>
            <h2>Our Predictions</h2>
            <p>With full confidence, we predict an Oklahoma City Thunder 125-113 victory over the Denver Nuggets. OKC is the 1 seed and swept the Memphis Grizzlies. If Chet Holmgren hit his free throws, the Thunder could be up 2-0 right now. In Game 2, 8 players recorded double digit points on the way to a 149-106 blowout win. Even though Game 3 is in Denver, this game should be an OKC win. If the Thunder come out like they did in Game 2, this game won't be close. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will have 32 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists. Nikola Jokic will have 35 points with 14 rebounds, along with 14 points for Russell Westbrook and 3 points for Michael Porter Jr.
            </p>
            <h2>Spread and Odds</h2>
            <p>Despite the game being in Denver, the spread is -5.5 OKC. The Thunder's moneyline is -240, compared to +198 for the Nuggets, meaning the Thunder are favored to win. The over/under is 232 total points.</p>

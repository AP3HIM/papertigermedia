                All rights go to the NBA and the teams
             </p> The Los Angeles Clippers, led by Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, will travel to Denver to play the Nuggets and Nikola Jokic in Game 7. The series started with an overtime win for Denver, in Denver, followed by a 3 point Clippers win. In Los Angeles, series tied at 1, the Nuggets got blown out in Game 3 and won on a buzzer beater dunk in Game 4. With the series tied at 2 going back to Denver, Jamal Murray exploded for 43 points and Russel Westbrook also scored 21, leading to a 3-2 Denver lead. Then, on Thursday night (Game 6), the Clippers won by 6 points in Los Angeles to force Game 7. Let's dive into our predictions and the odds. <p>
            </p>
            <h2>Our Predictions</h2>
            <p>We predict the Denver Nuggets will defeat the Los Angeles Clippers in a hard fought Game 7, 109-100. James Harden will have a double-double and Kawhi will hit some big threes, but it won't matter, as Nikola Jokic will record 27 points, 10 rebounds, and 14 assists. The Nuggets have only lost one game at home vs. the Clippers and in the last game they played at home, they beat the Clippers by 16 points. Because of this, Denver has a 15 point differential at home. While Michael Porter Jr is hurt, I am predicting good games from Christian Braun and Russell Westbrook. Denver will go on to play the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Semis. 
            </p>
            <h2>Spread and Odds</h2>
            <p>The spread is as close as it can get; +1 for the Clippers and -1 for the Nuggets, both at -110. The moneyline (as of Friday night) is +100 for the Clippers and -118 for the Nuggets. This means the Nuggets are favored over the Clippers. The over/under (total points scored by both teams) for the series is 205.5, indicating a low scoring game.</p>

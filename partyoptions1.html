            <h2>Looking Back on 2024</h2>
            <p>
                The election of 2024 was a failure for the Democrats. Joe Biden was the candidate until July 21, 2024, when he decided to drop out and hand the keys to Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris had only 107 days to run her campaign.  
                She ended up getting swept 7-0 in the swing states and lost the election 312-226.  
                For the first time in 20 years, a Democrat lost the popular vote. Harris finished with 75 million votes, while Trump had around 77 million votes.  
                It was a disaster for the Democrats, as almost the entire country shifted right. After this election, all Democrats have one question:  
                "Who will run in 2028?"

            <h2>Potential Candidates</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Josh Shapiro
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Josh Shapiro is the Governor of Pennsylvania and was previously the Attorney General of Pennsylvania.</li>

                        <li>Shapiro is popular in Pennsylvania and could carry the state in a potential 2028 run.</li>
                        <li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Possible, but unlikely.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Very likely. He has openly criticized Trump and seems ready to take a leadership role for the Democrats. There are some concerns, but Newsom still has time to improve his standing before the primaries.</li>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                As of now, Governor Pritzker and Governor Newsom seem like the frontrunners.  
                With over three years to go until Election Day 2028, much could change.

            <p>In the midst of a trade war and an election in the future, former banker Mark Carney was elected to be the new leader of the liberal party in Canada, succeeding Justin Trudeau and becoming the new Prime Minister of Canada.</p>
            <p>Carney, who turns 60 on Sunday, was named Governor of the Bank of Canada in 2007, where he was responsible for Canadian monetary policy during the global financial crisis. He held this role until 2013, when he was appointed as Governor of the Bank of England and led the British central bank's response to Brexit and the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
            </p>
            <p>Despite never being elected to office before, Mark Carney won 85.9% of the votes cast by Liberal Party members, beating  former finance minister Chrystia Freeland.

            <h2>Quotes About Trump and Tariffs</h2>

            </p>
            <p>In his victory speech at the liberal leadership convention in Ottawa, Carney attacked President Donald Trump and the tariffs placed on Canada: “There's someone who's trying to weaken our economy. Donald Trump. Donald Trump has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell, on how we earn a living. He's attacking Canadian workers, families and businesses. We can't let him succeed. I'm proud of the response of Canadians who are making their voices heard and their wallets felt. And I'm grateful for how Canadian provinces are stepping up to the fight. Because when we're united, we are Canada strong.”
            </p>
            <p>“The Canadian government is rightly retaliating with our own tariffs that will have maximum impact in the U.S. and minimum impact here in Canada. My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect. And make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade. In the meantime, we will ensure that all proceeds from our tariffs will be used to protect our workers.”
            </p>
            <p>Carney stated this right after: “America is not Canada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form. We didn't ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. So Americans should make no mistake: In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win. To the Americans, I say: like in hockey we will win.”  
            </p>
            
            <h2>Impact on Future Election</h2>
            <p><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-2.01/FullText.html" target="_blank"> The Canada Elections Act </a>  requires that the election must be held before October 20, 2025. Pierre Poilievre’s Conservative Party had long kept an at least 20 point lead over the Liberals. However, since Justin Trudeau’s resignation, and President Trump’s tariffs and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-talking-making-canada-51st-state/story?id=119767909" target="_blank">comments about Canada,</a> the gap has been closing. 
            </p>
            <p>Canadian voters have suggested that who might best stand up to President Trump has been a key question guiding the choice between Mark Carney and conservative Pierre Poilievre for the future election. </p>
            <p>In the same speech, Carney attacked Pierre Poilievre over his relationship with Trump. “Donald Trump thinks he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer. Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered. Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.”
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/poilievre-and-carney-lead-dealing-trump-yet-doubts-persist" target="_blank"> According to the latest polls,</a> 31% of Candians surveyed believe Poilievre would roll over and accept whatever Trump demands, contrasted by only 6% for Carney.

            <h2>Removal of Carbon Tax and Capital Gains Tax</h2>

            </p>
            <p>“So, my government will immediately eliminate the divisive consumer carbon tax on families, farmers and small- and medium-sized businesses. And we will stop the hike in the capital gains tax because we think builders should be incentivized for taking risks and rewarded when they succeed.”
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Carney has promised to remove the consumer carbon tax and the capital gains tax. A carbon tax is a policy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by placing a price on carbon pollution. In Canada, there are two main components: a consumer carbon price (affecting individuals through fuel costs) and an industrial carbon price (affecting large emitters). This means that extra costs on gas will be gone, saving consumers money. 
            </p>
            <p>A capital gains tax is a tax on the profit made from the sale of an asset, such as stocks or real estate. This is seen as a move to support investment and entrepreneurship. Carney’s actions seem to signal a shift in economic policy.
            </p>
            <p>Carney ended his speech looking to the future with hope: “To the families watching this evening in Fort Smith, in Edmonton and in every community across Canada, I promise you this: Together, we can — and will — get through this crisis. And we can — and will — come out of it stronger than ever because, Canada is built on the strength of its people. When we can cheer for different teams, and still be one team when it counts. When we come together, we build things that last. Because we are Canada strong. Vive le Canada!”
